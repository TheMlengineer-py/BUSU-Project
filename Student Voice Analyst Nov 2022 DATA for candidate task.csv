Under 21,The Business School/Faculty of Management,2nd Year,"Very comfortable, I can’t wait to get back","Student safety is important, but with the success of the vaccine in covering those most vulnerable to the virus it is paramount that we press to transition into a fully physical September so that students can get what they have payed for. By this June, everyone in my 2nd year will have spent 3/4s of their education and experience online and in lockdown tiers. We must return to campus."
21-24,Faculty of Science and Technology,3rd Year or Final Year,"Not at all comfortable, I have serious concerns","While case numbers are decreasing I do have great concerns that some rules of social distancing may not be possible to be enforced, and even then if cases rise again for some reason it may be that more strict measures will have to be implanted.

Maybe I would be okay with blended learning, like being on campus for seminars and workshops but nothing over 20-30 people."
Under 21,The Business School/Faculty of Management,2nd Year,"Comfortable, as long as everyone respects physical distancing rules, etc.",I feel excited to come back to campus as long as there are still some sort of restrictions towards the situation.  
Under 21,Faculty of Science and Technology,1st Year (including Foundation year),"Somewhat comfortable, but I have some concerns",I'm very worried because people don't take covid seriously.

Under 21,Faculty of Media and Communication,1st Year (including Foundation year),"Very comfortable, I can’t wait to get back","Covid has impacted some of the lectures drastically. Especially when talking about life drawing as pictures can never represent the experience of seeing the form in 3D. Having even one session a week of life drawing on campus would get us back into the sense of community and hands on experience that has been missing on Zoom.

Under 21,Faculty of Science and Technology,2nd Year,"Very comfortable, I can’t wait to get back","My views on Covid have been that the government has handled it very badly. From analysing data I believe we should of invested heavily into healthcare and taken precautionary measures such as wearing face masks and using hand sanitizer, but apart from that I think all fit and healthy under 50’s should have been able to have the option to work and live a normal life. However, if they are wary of covid or must shelter a particular relative then I support people having the option to opt out of in person education or work and they can take online classes or receive furlough pay.

Under 21,Faculty of Media and Communication,1st Year (including Foundation year),"Not at all comfortable, I have serious concerns","I won't be returning to campas based on what was said after an email sent out. I haven't even been back on campus yet but based on attitudes in our group chat and how people behaved at the beginning of the year, social distanceing wasn't observed, there's no guarantee people will be wearing masks at all time. It probably sounds bad but I don't trust my fellow students and I just don't trust anyone at this point. I'm having extreme anxiety about going back to something that appears normal, even going outside for things like food I find overwhelming. We won't be getting the vaccine until June and because people will still meet and not follow social distancing despite the rules, it puts students at risk. Additionally, if I were to return to campus, I would have to face the risk of passing a virus to two of my flatmates who are deemed vulnerable and I couldn't return to campus in good conscience knowing I could be putting them at risk. There's no vaccine available for students yet. With the talk of a booster vaccine and COVID being seasonal on the news, I want to continue wearing a face mask even when things are deemed 'normal' and there is a certain campus return. Again it probably sounds stupid but I am concerned people will make comments or will tell me I need to take the mask off and I don't feel like I'll be comfortable doing so. I've been doing online education for a year now, I'm probably more anxious, paranoid and depressed than ever and I don't believe a campus return will easily alleviate those feelings and if anything gives me additional stress and anxiety over the entire situation. I don't know many people on my course that I'd consider friends, I lack a support network and in general I just feel terrified about going back to campus."

21-24,Faculty of Science and Technology,3rd Year or Final Year,"Somewhat comfortable, but I have some concerns","I still have concerns about COVID considering most of us probably won’t be vaccinated until after this academic year ends but not only that, after spending the entire year online after having a placement year, i literally know no one on my course anymore (because they didn’t do placement so finished last year) so i’d feel uncomfortable going in in person with no mates "

Under 21,Faculty of Health and Social Sciences,1st Year (including Foundation year),"Very comfortable, I can’t wait to get back","I feel that it doesnt make sense that university students have been forced to do online learning when schools have not. I believe universities could have taken the same steps as schools and colleges. I am really looking forward to going onto campus as I am a first year and haven't experienced it yet, I am also vaccinated and understand by the time campus will open many other students will be too, therefore it will be a more comfortable learning environment."

Just ready to move forward. The university has dealt with the situation very well but unfortunately online learning was never going to give students value for money. We've learned a lot from it in terms of how we can be more sustainable, which is great, but it's just time to get back to campus and give students the full range of opportunities they've paid for but haven't recieved.

I’m also an ambivert but since lockdown I’ve become more introverted and the idea of being around lots of people feels intimidating. If there’s an understanding of this when coming back, then that would be great. I would also absolutely love to get to celebrate graduation. I miss my friends and being able to learn in person but my grades have improved since learning online, so for me, this is better. "
